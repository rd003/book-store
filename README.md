# BookStore

- It is my personal/hobby/practice project, just made for fun. Feel free to fork it, modify it.
- If you find any interesting enhancement idea or bug, feel free to open a issue or PR.
- This application is made in `angular` using `nx standalone` workspace.
- It is a self contained project, no external apis for data. I am using `local json` file as the db.
- For state management I have used the `Service with subject` approach, not using any state management library for simplicity.
- I have got the book.json file from this repo https://github.com/benoitvallon/100-best-books
and modified it according to my need. Feel free to visit this repo and consider to give a star.
- I am not an expert in angular, this code might not be using best practices. If you have any suggestions, I would be happy to know.
