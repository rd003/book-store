👉It is my personal/hobby/practice project, just made for fun. Feel free to fork it, modify it.
👉If you find any interesting enhancement idea or bug, feel free to open a issue or PR.
👉This application is made with nx angular standalone workspace.
👉It is a self contained project, no external apis for data. I am using local json file as the db.
👉For state management I have used the `Service with subject` approach, not using any state management library for simplicity.
👉I have got the book.json file from this repo https://github.com/benoitvallon/100-best-books
and modified it according to my need. Feel free to visit this repo and consider to give a star.
👉I am not an expert in angular, this code might not be using best practices. If you have any suggestions, I would be happy to know.
